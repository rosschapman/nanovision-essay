## nanovision-essay

At the start of 2014 I read Colin Milburn's [*Nanovision: Engineering the future*](http://www.amazon.com/Nanovision-Engineering-Future-Colin-Milburn/dp/0822342650), a literary exploration (cultural critique) of nanotechnology.  Having recently started a job at Science Exchange, it was a perfect read to wonder about science as a non-scientist.

This repo is becomes a literary encounter with *Nanovision*. There will be references to Baudrillard and Judith Butler and zen buddhism.  It should, I hope, be NSFW.
