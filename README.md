At the start of 2014 I read Colin Milburn's [*Nanovision: Engineering the future*](http://www.amazon.com/Nanovision-Engineering-Future-Colin-Milburn/dp/0822342650), an extensive cultural critique of nanotech.  Having recently started a job at [Science Exchange](http://www.scienceexchange.com), where half the team are trained scientists in a variety of fields, it was a perfect read to wonder about science and technology as a non-scientist - or maybe as a computer scientist of sorts.  Really as becoming posthuman.

This repo is becomes a literary encounter with *Nanovision*. There will be references to Baudrillard and Judith Butler and zen buddhism.  It should, I hope, be NSFW.
