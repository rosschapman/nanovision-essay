## Notes 
**Rereadings and note taking on a Saturday morning 2/8/14**


### Intro


   * The future and the present collapsing
   * The postbiological human
   * “Seeing is at stake” as we approach the singularity (2)
   * There is no more teleology of man, we move into infinity
   *  We are now always obsolete already
   * We have the vision of a posthuman cyborg.  We literally require other - nonhuman/ist - forms of perception (5)
   * Nanotech is the most prominent and promising technology of sci developments bringing us toward this Singularity (6)
   * “proximal limit of a future that cannot be known” (9)
   * Apple nano, “impossibly small”.  We touch the “impossible”.  (10)
   * Nanotech is a technological imperative beyond human control (10)
   * Lost in the acceleration (11)
   * nanovision is a prosthetic gaze across the Singularity
   * Def of nano vision (13) 
   * nanovision manages becoming while negotiating inevitability with an aversion to teleological grand narratives (15)

### 1

   * Science and science fiction coterminous (p25)
   * Encountering nano tech produces a “cognitive shock”, an “epistemic virus” producing a “terminal identity" (27)
   * Despite disciplinary agreement between experts, nanotech has definitely and definitively arrived (33)
   * Nanowriting echoes Baudrillard’s “precession of simulacra” - simulacra coming first, displacing and supplanting the real (40)
