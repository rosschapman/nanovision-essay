### Notes 
**Rereadings and note taking on a Saturday morning 2/8/14**


#### Intro


   * The future and the present collapsing
   * The postbiological human
   * “Seeing is at stake” as we approach the singularity (2)
   * There is no more teleology of man, we move into infinity
   *  We are now always obsolete already
   * We have the vision of a posthuman cyborg.  We literally require other - nonhuman/ist - forms of perception (5)
   * Nanotech is the most prominent and promising technology of sci developments bringing us toward this Singularity (6)
   * “proximal limit of a future that cannot be known” (9)
   * Apple nano, “impossibly small”.  We touch the “impossible”.  (10)
   * Nanotech is a technological imperative beyond human control (10)
   * Lost in the acceleration (11)
   * nanovision is a prosthetic gaze across the Singularity
   * Def of nano vision (13) 
   * nanovision manages becoming while negotiating inevitability with an aversion to teleological grand narratives (15)

#### 1

* Science and science fiction coterminous (p25)
* Encountering nano tech produces a “cognitive shock”, an “epistemic virus” producing a “terminal identity" (27)
* Despite disciplinary agreement between experts, nanotech has definitely and definitively arrived (33)
* Nanowriting echoes Baudrillard’s “precession of simulacra” - simulacra coming first, displacing and supplanting the real (40)
* "Semiotic drift", confusion of fiction and science fiction because scientists also write science fiction! (44)
* Feynman myth breaks down because he borrowed from Heinlein! (48)
* Nanovision entails an "embodied" & "cyborg logic" "mutually constitutive" (51)
* Multiple identities, "phases", "querred" post human bodies... (53)

#### 2
* "Global shrinkage" - Milburn may be playing with the Seinfeld episode, because he later discusses the threat to the fallus (60)
* The quantum corral - imagined as an act of manifest destiny and imperial expansion, control of the landscape (67)
* Conquest of world as picture, Heidegger (68)
* The quantum world is captured, imprisoned, Virilio (72/3)
* The StM also collapses distance and opens us up to revision at this site of subject/object failure
* The STM entails proleptic (existing before its time) view, a fucking into a frontier of frontiers (77)
* Because we breached the barrier of the known limit, a sort of proposed asymptotic step with the _real_ (something like the cadence of Moore's exponential thoery) is actually surpassed(78)
 * "Excess of ends" - Baudrillard (79)
 * We can already do things that we can't imagine (79)
* Vision is not longer optical or ocular, but haptic (85)
* There's a wonderful prosthesis using the STM - vs the haptic numbing of tablet-tech (Bret Victor: http://goo.gl/i3jBg8) - and "the human is made cyborg" (88)
