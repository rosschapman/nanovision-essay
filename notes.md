### Notes 
**Rereadings and note taking

#### General 
* Identify flux/fluidness
    * My first encounters with chat rooms, being able to be anyone, anything online.  Screen names re-identify. 
* Larger themes that emerge from this book:
 * Is nanotech about absolute control of matter or in the process of "demolishing the anthropic concept of control" (166)?
* Metaphor and semiotic construction - weaponry used to describe transgenic practices

#### Intro

   * The future and the present collapsing
   * The postbiological human
   * “Seeing is at stake” as we approach the singularity (2)
   * There is no more teleology of man, we move into infinity
   * We are now always obsolete already
   * We have the vision of a posthuman cyborg.  We literally require other - nonhuman/ist - forms of perception (5)
   * Nanotech is the most prominent and promising technology of sci developments bringing us toward this Singularity (6)
   * “proximal limit of a future that cannot be known” (9)
   * Apple nano, “impossibly small”.  We touch the “impossible”.  (10)
   * Nanotech is a technological imperative beyond human control (10)
   * Lost in the acceleration (11)
   * nanovision is a prosthetic gaze across the Singularity
   * Def of nano vision (13) 
   * nanovision manages becoming while negotiating inevitability with an aversion to teleological grand narratives (15)

#### 1

* Science and science fiction coterminous (p25)
* Encountering nano tech produces a “cognitive shock”, an “epistemic virus” producing a “terminal identity" (27)
* Despite disciplinary agreement between experts, nanotech has definitely and definitively arrived (33)
* Nanowriting echoes Baudrillard’s “precession of simulacra” - simulacra coming first, displacing and supplanting the real (40)
* "Semiotic drift", confusion of fiction and science fiction because scientists also write science fiction! (44)
* Feynman myth breaks down because he borrowed from Heinlein! (48)
* Nanovision entails an "embodied" & "cyborg logic" "mutually constitutive" (51)
* Multiple identities, "phases", "querred" post human bodies... (53)

#### 2
* "Global shrinkage" - Milburn may be playing with the Seinfeld episode, because he later discusses the threat to the fallus (60)
* The quantum corral - imagined as an act of manifest destiny and imperial expansion, control of the landscape (67)
* Conquest of world as picture, Heidegger (68)
* The quantum world is captured, imprisoned, Virilio (72/3)
* The StM also collapses distance and opens us up to revision at this site of subject/object failure
* The STM entails proleptic (existing before its time) view, a fucking into a frontier of frontiers (77)
* Because we breached the barrier of the known limit, a sort of proposed asymptotic step with the _real_ (something like the cadence of Moore's exponential thoery) is actually surpassed(78)
 * "Excess of ends" - Baudrillard (79)
 * We can already do things that we can't imagine (79)
* Vision is not longer optical or ocular, but haptic (85)
* There's a wonderful prosthesis using the STM - vs the haptic numbing of tablet-tech (Bret Victor: http://goo.gl/i3jBg8) - and "the human is made cyborg" (88)
* "Innate cyborg potential activities" (88) - the ability of technology to bring itself and the rest of the world inside (93)
* No longer subject to the "god-trick" (Haraway) of seeing everywhere.  Humans are "de-privileged" (104)
* Interlating "not predicated on the logic of control" (107) and nano vision discovers an "erotics" of itself (108)

#### 3 - Goo
* goo like ninja turtles maybe? (119)  not sure the relevance for what i care about but might be a cool sidebar
* (120) and finally the phallus.  goo as the maternal body that devours.  goo is a nocturnal emission that must be relegated to the basement.
* Derrida - goo cannot become signified - dissemination escapes this, "multiplication of essential meanings and vital fluids"; dissemination affirms  nonorigin
* goo represents a loss of mastery or fear of loss, loss of control of matter (ejaculation with reinscription) - perhaps a continuous ejaculation. (121)
* We have some perverse desire for an "ecophagy" (121) - our ecosystem being consumed
* Drexler becomes scapegoat - Zizek - (125)
* Talking about "goo" makes the discourse gooey, "discursive goo" (126)
* Goo science is then projected as a technoscientific stability (hard, a male authority); helps recast the conversation in gender models (128)
* Nanotech is assimilated into humanist models, what Mark Hansen calls "technesis" (128)
* What's interesting is that this humanizing opposes nanotech's "post-humanizing tendencies" (129)
* Nanotech = "monstrous-feminine"
* Narrative texts combat goo (132) as well as scientific discourse (136) using the "matrix of humanism".
* The terminatrix is the castrating/goo, situate threat of technology in the realm of feminine seduction (141)
* impatient future does not wait for future (164)
* The post vital, "machine  phylum" (Deleuze/Guattari). Rebirthal traversal across the surface tension, after disintegration. (166)
* Certain narrative futures explore the beginning of a new kind of postvital, posthumanist life, surplus, in a new type of assemblage (180)
* The post biological entity wants not, (181) it has plenty and abundance (183)
* Nanovision is a site of xenomorphosis - becoming alien to ourselves (184), avatars?
* Nanofiction imagines a "body without organs" (Deleuze), our normal organisms are "user illusion" (185)
