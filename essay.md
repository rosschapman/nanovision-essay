Ouvre

Do you remember when you first fell in love with computers?  

Maybe it wasn't computers, per se.  Likely so.  Maybe it was a love of mastery, of manipulating and animating creatures with explosive results through endless multitudes of environments.  Far beyond what the single-expression plastic figurines could *do*.  Perhaps TV made us bored with the He-man's limited range of expression.  Arms go round.  Let's make him to do the splits until he breaks his dick!  

The keypress lights an inner puppeteer's awakening as s/he steers dragons blowing and bursting bubbles through infinite mazes.  Whole huge worlds explored.  Bubble Bobble, dude.  That shit was amazing.

It could have been my first love of love, even a sexual awakening.  Most probably sex?  I like to think it was because sex is incredible. Sex's power and meaning is still super macro in an America that represses and traumatizes it (made bigger because of this, sure); in a technological epoch that has little use for human bodies any longer.  Sex is a primal drive of seemingly endless resource.  Why wouldn't it have been that?

The other day a coworker and I traded origin stories about our love of computers.  He had a really cool story from his youth, like 10 years old!, about when he changed the rules of Worm by tweaking a variable to `false` and unleashed the worm outside its anticipated patterns.  From then on he was "got", in love.

My love origin was first Bubble Bobble and the Oregon trail around the same time - games to shoot, destroy, strategize, and hunt, explore worlds.  But a more important moment, I think, was when I truly began to explore the power of the network, the internet - to be really really excited by computers - when I was around 12.  Coincidentally in the internet's nascent stages too - so it was truly an adolescent flirt.  Though it's hard to imagine not being seduced at any moment in the network's lifetime, when chat rooms came online for non super-geeks through AOL cd-roms, the bio-tech pheromone exchange was upon me.  

Around 12 I posed and lurked and dirty-talked in AOL sex chat rooms, usually as a 20-something, like `22M`.  But I also tried at `F` sometimes to test versions of the conversation - like, what type of other human might talk to me and what might they say.  Totally an RPG where you could embody multiple digital selves.  I was a man or woman.  Easily.  `rchap1` was my screen name.  A [recombinated](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_recombination) name for networked surfaces that pointed bits toward a teenager behind a desk in Chicago.   

If you are like me, you are part of a generation that has experienced our sex and gender encoded as bits, thereby freed, thereby enslaved again, in some sort of intractable recursive function that is practically a laughing matter as tech evolves.  Matter laughing.  But there's no question that modern desire is near completely framed and enhanced by tech and visual technologies, whether inspired by TV and MMO fantasy, google glass omnipotence, or a the cuddle of a bracelet that knows when we sleep.  Pillow talk.  

As time passes the line between bio and tech continues to flee, or is deterritorialized.  At the very least, problematized in some way that you can't deny is interesting, right?  And I think we are all transforming rapidly - our generation and next.  Because of fire, the cotton gin, and computers.  I mean it's not a simple blurring or dissolving of the difference because we now have an inescapable interdependence with tech.  We are in an explosive continuum of multitude that I think is a beautiful, hard love. Gosh, wearable tech and [cochlear implants](http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2014/mar/28/deaf-40-year-old-women-hears-sound-first-time-video), [hamburgers grown in labs](http://www.popsci.com/technology/article/2013-08/first-lab-grown-hamburger-served),  gives us no doubt about a disruption to our classical biological lives and personhoods - literally environments where person might dwell.  We are going through a divorce, and taking on many new lovers.  What's great is that with Oculus VR we can make love to them through their eyes.  And that's no longer science fiction or in the horror room of Hollywood's basement. 

The reason I'm even writing about this is because I read a book recently that totally excited my cultural critical imagination in a way it hadn't been in a long time.  And obviously a "self" reflection.  Have you read Colin Milburn's _Nanovision_?  I found it off a college reading list from my alma mater one night trying to stumbleupon _something_ that I could/should _read_ and help kick a TV addiction (so many good shows!).  I think I had just started watching 30 Rock _again_.  

Turns out this book is an awesome exploration of science and culture and the biologic's love affair with the technic.  And how together how these two lovebirds are dismantling the classical world.  Milburn levels a critical scope on nanotechnology and the attendant cultural productions and discourse of scientists and science fiction auteurs alike.  He calls forth this rich cultural space/surface/cyberspace as a visual field called _Nanovision_.  And he deploys all your faves to help him make sense of the way this present Discourse is important: Derrida and his simulacra, Lacan's sex stuff and real, Zizek's sublime, Kristeva's abjection, and my personal fave Deleuze and his body without organs.  

I won't attempt to recreate all of Milburn's arguments in this essay.  This is really more of a book report *on ecstasy* that will discuss a few themes that got my mind grapes a flutter, including:

- Science (real) and science-fiction (imaginary) "visions" of nanotech as frictional co-conspirators that through their dialectic free us from space-time.
- The identity crisis that Nanovision manufactures and the cyborg or postbiological revolution that may result - which God and man will be unable to stop because it's already too late.
- How the danger and posed by the possible liberatory consequences of Nanovision are a threat to males and therefore inscribed as woman/female. As in, the domestic violence and misogyny of nanotech opponents.

**The power of visions**

I'm fascinated by things that release possibility.  From sex to the scientific method.  Well nanotech and its discourse, Nanovision, may be the most powerful releaser to date if we believe Milburn.  

Milburn tracks an undeniable way that the imagination of scientists and dreamers of scientific possibilities (scientists or not) cause a severe and sort of glorious glimpse into and beyond the unknown.  

I find this loop fascinating.  Or maybe it's not so much a loop but a totally integrated condition of imagination and real without beginning and end.  Milburn discusses it with more academic aplomb, but however we characterize the increasing difficulty to understand what may or may not occur in the future, it's a weird mind-fuck that's a total truth of our highly technologized era. 

Milburn actually calls it a “cognitive shock”, an “epistemic virus” producing a “terminal identity".   

Believers in nanotech, the scientists and sci-fi auteurs, espouse predictions, scenarios, and imaginations that nanotech will be a part of future human life.  But the A future, rather THE future, is inevitable.  Actually already _is_ inevitable.  Made inevitable because in our technologic era of constant change we are caught in an unstoppable momentum of progress, an accelerating march of advancement.  We are always living a future in the present.  Milburn actually discusses this at length, somewhat pinning the whole book from the start on the cognitive and temporal unwraveling that nanotech creates, that nano vision envisions.  

Exposure to nanotech, nanovision goggles on everyone, has caused us to breach a sacred, perhaps humanist, boundary with history and ontological reasonings.  Milburn calls it a "cognitive shock, an "epistemic virus."  We've crashed, slipped through a [Moore-ish](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore's_law) asymptote entirely - we've broken through what Milburn calls the Singularity.  The present is already cast away, or collapsed into the future.  On some level I think we can all relate to this concept.  Technological advances, whether the self-driving car or organ printing, require considering a present position to a WTF future at all times, a "proximal limit of a future that cannot be known," as Milburn says.  He has us consider Apple's ad for the Nano.  Remember the Nano?  ["Impossibly small"](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7C0sVGIMSYw).  Fucking Jobs I love your wordplay.

So who are we now, then?  Have we become/becoming something else? And how do we react to that transformation?  Loop my gender questions

but also a sensical version of the future. Techno-queering of personhood. But combined with a loss of discernible, humanist future Digital self is like whatever.  Like, go crazy on your avatar.  Also get lasik, get "fake" boobs, take all the performance enhancing drugs, take the recreational ones, optimize your brain 'puter with chia seeds and acai (i'd say this body hacking is technologic), extend your brain into the network with a mobile, control the machines with mind chips.  It's only the beginning.

Milburn discusses how Richard Feynman's lecture to the American Physical Society at Caltech in 1959, _There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom_, was a genesis moment of the nanotech field.    A visionary moment, a precog event inspiring the hard science.  And thus a feedback loop began where the imagination of the possibilities (and horrors!) of nano science continued to waltz (even twerk) with the actual scientific breakthroughs and realizations of atomic-level tinkering.
