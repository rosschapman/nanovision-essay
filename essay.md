Highlights:

**The science (real) and science-fiction (imaginary) of nanotech are equally powerful co-revolutionaries - though often at odds.**

**Yet, their productions and performance together liberate us from life, death, space, and time.**

**What's more, science/SciFi method and inquisition effect identity crisis of the best kind; the creation of cyborgs, "terminal identity," and postbiological life.**

**Yet, there's a sad experience experience for us (scientists, filmmakers, politicians, etc...) when we meet nanotech.  Some seriously crazy possibilities and liberations are captured and held hostage through classic defense mechanisms: colonization of the atomic land to fight xenomorphosis; reifying dangers and doomsday outcomes (the enemy combatant) as female/woman/vagina in order to trump up support against a credible threat to male phallic supremacy.  Various tactics to resist a healthy merger between the macro and micro, man and machine, something beyond Logos and classic teleologies of (white) Man's manifest supremacy - which, as Milburn suggests throughout, may just be to penetrate everywhere and a more transformative love!**  

Milburn's book discusses nanotechnology and the attendant cultural productions and discourse of scientists and science fiction auteurs alike.  He creates the term *Nanovision* to describe this literally and literarily *visual* field.  Anointed thus because the discourse of nanotechnology has drastically changed the way we "see" the world.  "It is a way of seeing space beyond the closure of an ocular centric regime that Gilles Delueze has called "haptic vision"...when sight discovers in itself a specific function of touch that is uniquely its own, distinct from its optical function." (85)  We discover that the scientific breakthroughs themselves proceed from machines (STI) that create new sight and insight on the atomic field.  A virtualized physical contact so different than a subject-object perception across the distance of the erstwhile microscopic lens.  And Milburn deploys all your faves to help him make sense of the way that _Nanovision_ is new: 

**Derrida and his simulacra.**
**Lacan's sex stuff and real.**
**Zizek's sublime.**
**Kristeva's abjection.**
**And my personal fave: Deleuze and his body without organs.**  

The book is for scientists, cultural critics, theorists, feminists alike.  Or, if you're like me, someone that drifts along the surface tension of these environs at different access points.  In some ways it is an ultimate deconstruction project, considering the subject matter is that thing where matter and all that matters is mutable.  Straight flux.  Regardless, because there's enough pinot involved, we're doing this and I hope you'll like it and maybe the read the book and talk about it with me over tea.

## The power of visions

Nanotech's inception is often attributed to a visionary lecture Richard Feynman gave at Caltech in 1959 called *There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom*.  But Milburn is quick to point out that Feynman's speech uses language directly from Heinlein.  Whoops.  So science truly is a dialectic tango between the real and fantasy.

Milburn seems compelled to begin at this meeting place, as if any analysis of nanotech must include consideration of both the science _and_ science fiction that shapes its theory and practice. Otherwise we might miss the whole impact of this new invention on our present and future materiality and subjectivity.  I'll explore these themes a bit more later but the science/fiction exploration responds with a mixed payload:

of possibilities (or fears) unleashed by the STM as it peers upon the atomic landscape
of fear (or excitement, jouissance) unleashed by imagined destruction by swarms (Thor 2, Terminator 3)
```
----
of by interior agents (example, example) shift us in relatively important  ways.  
----

Here's a personal anecdote where I literally _felt_ this sci/fi menage. 

I read Greg Bear's *Blood Music* shortly after *Nanovision*.  It's one of these examples of "hard" science fiction - where the science driving the plot is validated just _enough_ by experimental conclusions in first life labs - published papers and so forth.  Books like these totally tango.  Milburn calls it  "semiotic drift" (44) - he's right that there is a kind of losing of way in literary worlds like these.  Reading _Blood Music_, you're own emotions and imaginations swirl in a maytag - you at once feel the weight of this weird science's proximate believability, but also anxious wonderment that this has to be bullshit because the implications are too vast and dire.  It's Baudrillard's precession of simulacra all over again.  It's not that the science and fiction exploit each other as copies or  some flattering inheritance,  but there's a continuous layering of realities; of needing each other, weaving their way through each other's suggestions - more of a cellular imbrication.  Maps on models on maps.  "Terminal circularity" (52) of science and fiction, of man and machine.  Ugh, yeah, science is never exact, but more like an [*Exactitude of Science*]().  

We are all aware of this on some level as humans in our current networked age.  While we don't confront it's monumental consequence in moments during our quotidian affairs, the average  human of the first world uses computers to guide her through most arenas of modern living - work, relationships, etc... do you not wonder about the the truth, the material real, of your life?

```javascript
// A JavaScript Poem
var likes == kisses on the couch(function(){
	var mortgage payments == domain registration(function(){
		var digital currency == minimum wage();
	})
})
```

[Need some sort of transition here.]

Even the "failure of disciplinary cohesion so far has certainly not diminished the sense that as a scientific field--perhaps unified in name only, but still a field--nanotechnology has *arrived*." (33)  And that's part of a more startling point!  Milburn's startling point.  Equipped with nanovision, whose planes and lines have been sharpening focus since 1959, we are already incorporated in a permanent imperative void of telos.  The story of nanotech cannot be told without reading in and through and between the lines, etc... of science and science fiction.  Together they fuel and accelerate an increasing speed into new futures while recombinating our present with new future imaginations.

## Fake boobs were sooooo pre-Singularity.

_Nanovision_ is companion lit to Ray Kurzweil.  Milburn demonstrates nanotech as another innovation urging our ever-quickening nosedive toward the technological Singularity.  That is: a break with history, the end of spiritual and religious teleologic imperatives, and of course the beginning of posthuman existence.  

Of course, nanotechnology is hardly the first thing to come along and problematize humanist perceptions of personhood and agency and accelerate the Singularity's event horizon.  Let's observe interactions with computers because I want to digress just a little bit into personal narrative.  It's the pinot.

When I was twelve years old I would pose as a 22F (or some such) in AOL sex chat rooms, a little horn-ball who had discovered a realm where you could get nasty with who you were and what you said.  How liberating that a screen name could be, was, a totally non-gendered, non-human signifier.  The sack of cells and water at a desk on Chicago's north side was becoming moot with networked key punches.  I'd say by the early '90s we see terminal identity truly activated amongst a growing class of digital elite. Way before I knew how to sudo...myself was extended into virtual infinity. An initial human biological id urge encoded into digital fantasy.

Nanotech is a special urge toward the Singularity because it's "construction of bodies and machines are mutually constitutive." (51)  The technology of the small, and the interior, totally collapses the separation of man and machine.    Like, even virtual queering and collapse of space on a computer screen - whether in Chicago or on millions of other consoles - is a half-step because there's an off switch. But nanotech super sizes the problematic: "sex and sexuality made infinitely malleable, sexual difference slipping into sexual indeterminacy or deferral" (53) because it's [_physical_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWz9VN40nCA&feature=kp).  

Gender non-conformist cis-boy boss tycoons up in this *.biz.
Exponential explosion, infinite excess of possibility.  

The future is never the same anymore.  

Nanotech's promises don't simply extend our contract with technology and an enhanced existence; distinctions between the tech, mech, and man are gone.  Nanotech makes an absolute claim on our human corpus from the inside out and materiality seems no longer...so simple.  Integration (rather than separation) anxiety!  Tony Stark won't be able to leave the suit!  Actually, each cell of his body will become an iron man. A bazillion little Jarvis'.

The tango is sweaty, man.

## Shock section. Liberation section

I think we can all relate to a kind of wave of future-forward imperative in which contemporary tech sweeps us up.  Our expectation of advancement never dwindles now. We are all aware of Moore's law, if only subconsciously as observers of the shrinking cost and increased power of consumer electronics on the Best Buy shelves.

But Milburn says that nanoscience, nanovision goggles on everyone, has caused us to breach a sacred, humanist, boundary with history and ontological reasonings.  It "signals the opening of a way of interrelating with forms of molecular being that are not predicated on the logic of control." (107)  And: "When worlds collide, it is no longer possible for one world to look at the other from a secure distance, from a godlike vantage point (what Haraway has called the scientific 'god-trick' of seeing everything from nowhere.)"  And: "The concept of limit has cavalierly been surpassed." (78)  Breaching this Moore-ish asymptotic lock-step waltz we endure the epistemic shock of the Singularity.  Nanovision's prosthesis actually sees beyond the "proximal limit of a future that cannot be known" (9) as its laboratory scopes (Scanning Tunneling Microscopes, or STMs) image atoms and its literary imaginary explores post-human conscious goo.  I think it's not too hard to get on board with this idea.  Consider "simpler" technological advances like the self-driving car or organ printing.  These require considering a present position to a WTF future at all times.  Like, can you really make confident assumptions about "human life" in the future anymore?  At the least, we are absolutely sure it's going to look totally weird and awesome, but we know it's likely something beyond our current comprehension or imagination.  "The future ain't what it used to be." (Yogi Berra, by way of Kurzweil's _The Singularity Is Near_)

Thus, nanoscience moves us into a kind of infinity as the possibility of infinite combinations at the atomic level release infinite possibilities.  Or "phases" of life, users, bodies without organs to dream about and begin to live through imagination or in virtuality.  "But every actual body also has a virtual dimension: a vast reservoir of potential traits, connections, affects, movements, etc."  We are going through a divorce, and taking on many new lovers.  Baudrillard: "It would seem then that there will be no end because we are already in excess of ends." (79) And so the future and present is somehow collapsed in a pregnant vacuum of branching multiplicities rather than a weave of one dialectic figure eight.  "We can really do things we can't imagine right now." (79)  Like the a tango inside the tango sweat. 

Right, so maybe it's not too hard to drift there philosophically with Milburn. So what are we becoming, then?  Have we become/becoming something else? And how do we react to that transformation?  Suddenly I daydream of managing multiple offline identities.  What IRL offscreen-name will you choose today?  More pinot.

## The sadness

Yet, as the containment of possibility is shattered by nanotech's "perpendicular penetration into the invisible, its pornographic drive to open and expose" (87) an "ineffable" exteriority that Lacan describes as that which "resists symbolization absolutely" (76), Milburn examines the way that nano writing and nanotechnologists recoil from the liberation of time, space, meaning, worlds, "leaving a wake of rationality and reason behind", a "casual domestication of the sublime" (81), "the sense that the impossible has been made possible, that the future has been enveloped by the present, that space and time have been captured and controlled." (78)

Therein lies the great sadness of nanovision.  I mean, not surprising.  I think we can all agree that when we first meet the unknown our wonder and curiosity can metamorph to insecurity and a need to rationalize.  The deeper cultural criticism we don't always confront is how the rationalization of the abject, alterity, the sublime, the alien, the other, is easily reinscribed in a humanist matrix of genderized opposition or (white) man's manifest entitlement.  Which generally means that this _otherness_ is encoded as a threat to white male supremacy - therefore a threat to normalcy and dudes' hard dicks.

Lets explore a couple of the examples Milburn discusses.

The visualization of the atomic field by the STM becomes an origin of literature which clearly reveals the unspoken agenda of the male scientists who pioneered nanotech.    



Colonization of the feminine and enslaving through the image:

make these wonders small
terra incognita
nothing escapes (71) the imaging
power of observation conquers (73)
quaint small feminized (80)
manifest destiny (67)

More sulkiness and goo:

fear of the abject (kristeva) of the fluids we commonly dispel
dissolution of the human subject (120)
jizz and nonorigin (120)
	no beginning or end buddhistness?
hard science inoculates agains the injurious goo
technesis - humanizing technology
threatens the matrix of humanism
monstrous-feminine (131)
fecundity without insemination!
The post biological entity wants not, (181) it has plenty and abundance (183)

 


---------------------------

Milburn discusses how Richard Feynman's lecture to the American Physical Society at Caltech in 1959, _There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom_, was a genesis moment of the nanotech field.    A visionary moment, a precog event inspiring the hard science.  And thus a feedback loop began where the imagination of the possibilities (and horrors!) of nano science continued to waltz (even twerk) with the actual scientific breakthroughs and realizations of atomic-level tinkering.

--------------------------------

"When worlds collide, it is no longer possible for one world to look at the other from a secure distance, from a godlike vantage point (what Haraway has called the scientific 'god-trick' of seeing everything from nowhere.)"

Milburn refers to this domain as the postbiological or posthuman.  Turning a critical gaze on fiction for clues on how we're absorbing this new science, Milburn uncovers both happy and sad paradigms.  At the frightening end of the scale,  catastrophic violent swarms and the commonly deployed _goo_ scenario.  At the happy end - as in Greg Bear's *Blood Music* -  we get enlightened communal xenomorphosis.  But either side of the coin we're facing a massive transformation.

You might be saying, "Well yeah, if nanotech actually succeeds."  But you know it's going to succeed!


  Milburn calls it a "cognitive shock, an "epistemic virus."  We've crashed, slipped through a [Moore-ish](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore's_law) asymptote entirely - we've broken through what Milburn calls the Singularity.  The present is already cast away, or collapsed into the future.  On some level I think we can all relate to this concept.  Technological advances, whether the self-driving car or organ printing, require considering a present position to a WTF future at all times, a "proximal limit of a future that cannot be known," as Milburn says.  He has us consider Apple's ad for the Nano.  Remember the Nano?  ["Impossibly small"](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7C0sVGIMSYw).  Fucking Jobs I love your wordplay.

  Loop my gender questions 

The line between bio and tech continues to flee.  Is deterritorialized.  At the very least, problematized in some way that you can't deny is interesting, right?  I'd say we are all transforming rapidly - our generation and next.  Because of fire, the cotton gin, and computers.  I mean it's not a simple blurring or dissolving of the difference because we now have an inescapable interdependence with tech.  We are in an explosive continuum of multitude that I think is a beautiful, hard love. Gosh, wearable tech and [cochlear implants](http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2014/mar/28/deaf-40-year-old-women-hears-sound-first-time-video), [hamburgers grown in labs](http://www.popsci.com/technology/article/2013-08/first-lab-grown-hamburger-served),  gives us no doubt about a disruption to our classical biological lives and personhoods - literally environments where person might dwell.    What's great is that with Oculus VR we can make love to them through their eyes.  And that's no longer science fiction or in the horror room of Hollywood's basement.
