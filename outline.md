### Outline

* **Quick intro**:
	* I joined a company about science so I decided to read a book about science and it sorta got me thinking a lot.  So much that I wanted to share.
	* Immediately the book appealed to my interest in radical identities. 
* **Possible sections**:
	* Tech imagined is as great a force as tech realized. Media influences culture and literally our way of seeing and constructing our foresight.  
		* I think reading this book helped me look at science as this dynamic pursuit because the project of discovery creates cognitive possibility as well as tangible, applicable breakthroughs. 
		*	The power of metaphor and metonyms.  Possible exploration of weaponry used to describe Transgenic experiments.
	* Nanotech is already the breach beyond a Singularity of future possible.  We are already infinite and obsolete in our current organism - a present already cast away.  
	* Nanotechnology is a perfect example of a field that is dynamic problematic of real and imagined.
	* Nanotechnology, and the _nanovision_ that accompanies, by interacting with not only the tech/"real" science but also the science fiction and scientific discourse, opens up incredible conceptual refactors of life - feminine monsters, goos, swarms, not-wanting, already complete and satisfied.
	* Nanotechnology and nanovision introduces a fabulous array of new identies:
		* Terminal identity
		* User illusion  
		* Phases 
		* Xenomorphosis
		* A body without organs 
			*  "But every actual body also has a virtual dimension: a vast reservoir of potential traits, connections, affects, movements, etc." (Wikipedia)
			*  The first determination that comes to mind apropos of Deleuze is that he is the philosopher of the Virtual - and the first reaction to it should be to oppose Deleuze's notion of the Virtual to the'all-pervasive topic of virtual reality: what matters to Deleuze is not virtual reality, but the reality of the virtual (which, in Lacanian terms, is the Real." Virtual Reality in itself is a rather miserable idea: that of imitating reality, of reproducing its experience in an artificial medium. The reality of the Virtual, on the other hand, stands for the reality of the Virtual as such, for its real effects and consequences. Let us take an attractor in mathematics: all positive lines or points in its sphere of attraction only approach it in an endless fashion, never reaching its form - the existence of this form is purely virtual, being nothing more than the shape towards which lines and points tend. However, precisely as such, the virtual is the Real of this field: the immovable focal point around which all elements circulate. Is not this Virtual ultimately the Symbolic as such? Let us take symbolic authority: in order to function as an effective authority, it has to remain not- fully-actualized, an eternal threat.
	* The discursive field of nanotech, including the critical writing on the subject, stages a few interesting "plays": 
		* A battle of sex, where the gender binary is reaffirmed to help make sense of an alterity or abjection.
		* A humanism vs a posthumanism || postbiological || cyborg.
		* Colonialism vs trojan horsed, already colonized, genetic maps for cyborg conscious activated.
		* Bio vs tech, and the boundaries disappeared.
* **My editorial?**:
	* Our species is woefully simple to embrace the reality of Brownian motion.
