### Outline

* **Quick intro**:
	* I joined a company about science so I decided to read a book about science and it sorta got me thinking a lot.  So much that I wanted to share.
	* Immediately the book appealed to my interest in radical identities. 
* **Possible sections**:
	* Tech imagined is as great a force as tech realized. Media influences culture and literally our way of seeing and constructing our foresight.  
		* I think reading this book helped me look at science as this dynamic pursuit because the project of discovery creates cognitive possibility as well as tangible, applicable breakthroughs. 
		*	The power of metaphor and metonyms.  Possible exploration of weaponry used to describe Transgenic experiments.
	* Nanotech is already the breach beyond a Singularity of future possible.  We are already infinite and obsolete in our current organism - a present already cast away.  
	* Nanotechnology is a perfect example of a field that is dynamic problematic of real and imagined.
	* Nanotechnology, and the _nanovision_ that accompanies, by interacting with not only the tech/"real" science but also the science fiction and scientific discourse, opens up incredible conceptual refactors of life - feminine monsters, goos, swarms, not-wanting, already complete and satisfied.
	* Nanotechnology and nanovision introduces a fabulous array of new identies:
		* Terminal identity
		* User illusion  
		* Phases 
		* Xenomorphosis
		* A body without organs 
			*  "But every actual body also has a virtual dimension: a vast reservoir of potential traits, connections, affects, movements, etc." (Wikipedia)
	* The discursive field of nanotech, including the critical writing on the subject, stages a few interesting "plays": 
		* A battle of sex, where the gender binary is reaffirmed to help make sense of an alterity or abjection.
		* A humanism vs a posthumanism || postbiological || cyborg.
		* Colonialism vs trojan horsed, already colonized, genetic maps for cyborg conscious activated.
		* Bio vs tech, and the boundaries disappeared.
* **My editorial?**:
	* Our species is woefully simple to embrace the reality of Brownian motion.
